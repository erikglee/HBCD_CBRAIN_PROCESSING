              thousands of studies using techniques such as functional MRI and
              diffusion weighted imaging have allowed for the non-invasive study
              of the brain. Despite the fact that MRI is routinely used to
              obtain data for neuroscience research, there has been no widely
              adopted standard for organizing and describing the data collected
              in an imaging experiment. This renders sharing and reusing data
              (within or between labs) difficult if not impossible and
              unnecessarily complicates the application of automatic pipelines
              and quality assurance protocols. To solve this problem, we have
              developed the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), a standard for
              organizing and describing MRI datasets. The BIDS standard uses
              file formats compatible with existing software, unifies the
              majority of practices already common in the field, and captures
              the metadata necessary for most common data processing operations.",

               analyses. CBRAIN's flexible meta-scheduling has allowed the

               Computing (HPC) centers in Canada, one in Korea, one in Germany,

              In this work, we introduce a framework for creating, testing,

              technologies that encapsulate all binary and other dependencies in
              one convenient package. BIDS Apps run on all three major operating
              systems with no need for complex setup and configuration and
              thanks to the comprehensiveness of the BIDS standard they require
