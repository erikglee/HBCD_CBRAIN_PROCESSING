Understanding Boutiques Descriptors
===================================

`Boutiques descriptors <https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.09713>_` are
flexible JSON-based instructions that describe how a containerized
application can be interacted with. For example, this includes descriptions
of the expected inputs and outputs for a pipeline, and the arguments
that can be used to configure processing. 

CBRAIN utilizes Boutiques descriptors to provide a consistent
interface for interacting with containerized pipelines. Because


that are way inputs and outputs should be structured, text-based instructions thathow CBRAIN understands how to interact with a
containerized pipeline. This means that the descriptor
