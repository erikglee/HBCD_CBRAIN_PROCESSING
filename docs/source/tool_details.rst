Tool Details Overview
=====================

The pages linked towards the bottom provide information about the tools used
for HBCD processing. Details including which arguments
are used for processing, and which files are required for processing
are also found in these pages.

These pages are intended to provide a general reference for users who are
interested in understanding how processing is conducted. All pages
that you see below are auto-populated based on the processing configuration
files in the `HBCD_CBRAIN_PROCESSING repository <https://github.com/erikglee/HBCD_CBRAIN_PROCESSING>`_,
and versions of the Boutiques descriptors that we have stored in CBRAIN.
For HBCD datasets that are processed in CBRAIN, similar information is
also automatically saved out to the subject level derivatives folder. These files
are directly derived from the processing task, providing a more accurate and robust
description than the summary provided here. If you are interested in learning
about these files, please see :doc:`this page <hidden_proc_details_folder>`.
